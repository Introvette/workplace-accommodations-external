          The ADA, as amended, protects the rights of employees and job seekers
          with disabilities. An individual with a disability is defined as a
          person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially
          limits one or more major life activities, a person who has a history
          or record of such an impairment, or a person who is perceived by
          others as having such an impairment.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for
            oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping,
            walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning,
            reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.
          </li>
          <li>
            Under the ADA, as amended, "major life activities" is expanded to
            include "major bodily functions." major bodily functions include,
            but are not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell
            growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory,
            circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.

          Under the ADA, you must be a qualified individual with a disability
          who is capable of performing the essential functions of a position,
          with or without reasonable accommodations.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This requirement assures that individuals will not be considered
            unqualified simply because of an inability to perform marginal or
            incidental job functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations to
            qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or
            applicants for employment unless doing so would cause an undue
            hardship.
          </li>
          <li>
            A person with a disability who is unable to perform the essential
            functions of a position, with or without reasonable accommodations,
            is not a “qualified” individual with a disability within the meaning
            of the ADA.
          </li>
          <li>
            Although reasonable accommodations must be provided to qualified
            individuals, significant modifications and/or restructuring of the
            essential job duties so that a position no longer resembles its
            purpose are generally not considered reasonable. In other words, an
            employer does not have to eliminate the fundamental duties of the
            position.

        <p>
          A reasonable accommodation is an accommodation that enables the
          employee to perform the essential functions of their position, is
          medically necessary, and does not create an undue hardship on the
          institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some accommodations can be approved at the department level and others
          require a formal interactive process which requires coordination

          Office.

          When requesting a workplace accommodation that is obvious, employees
          may not need to go through a formal step-by-step process.

        <p>
          For example, if an employee who uses a wheelchair requests that their
          desk be elevated to ensure that it is above the arms of the
          wheelchair, the employee’s supervisor may voluntarily comply and have
          the desk elevated appropriately. In this case, an accommodation has
          been requested, identified, and provided without the need for a formal
          process.

          When requesting a workplace accommodation that may not be obvious, an

          <li>
            Consults with the individual with a disability to ascertain the
            precise job-related limitations imposed by the individual's
            disability and how those limitations could be overcome with a
            reasonable accommodation;
          </li>
          <li>
            Identifies potential accommodations and assesses the effectiveness
            each would have in enabling the individual to perform the essential
            functions of the position; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Considers the preference of the individual to be accommodated and
            selects and implements the accommodation that is most appropriate

            <b>Interactive Process</b> - A discussion in which employees and
            employers work together in demonstrating a good faith effort to
            comply with the ADA, to streamline the accommodation process and to
            help ensure that effective accommodations are provided.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Interactive Process</b> – A means recommended by the EEOC in
            which employees and employers work together in demonstrating a good
            faith effort to comply with the ADA, to streamline the accommodation

            provided.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Major Life Activity</b> – Refers to activities that an average
            person can perform with little or no difficulty. Major life
            activities include, but are not limited to: caring for oneself,
            performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking,
            standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing,
            learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating,
            interacting with others and working; and the operation of a major
            bodily function, including functions of the immune system, special
            sense organs and skin; normal cell growth; and digestive,
            genitourinary, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory,
            circulatory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hemic, lymphatic,
            musculoskeletal and reproductive functions. The operation of a major
            bodily function includes the operation of an individual organ within
            a body system.

            medical condition.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Disabilities</b> – A qualified employee or applicant with a
            disability is an individual who, with or without a reasonable
            accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the job in
            question.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Reasonable Accommodations</b> – A modification or adjustment to a
            job, the work environment, or the way things are usually done during
            the hiring process. These modifications enable an individual with a
            disability to have an equal opportunity not only to get a job, but
            successfully perform their job tasks to the same extent as people
            without disabilities. The ADA requires reasonable accommodations as
            they relate to three aspects of employment:
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>ensuring equal opportunity in the application process;</li>
            <li>
              enabling a qualified individual with a disability to perform the
              essential functions of a job;
            </li>
            <li>
              making it possible for an employee with a disability to enjoy
              equal benefits and privileges of employment.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Undue Hardship</b> – An employer is not required to make an
            accommodation if it would impose an “undue hardship” on the
            operation of the employer’s business. “Undue hardship” is defined as
            an “action requiring significant difficulty or expense” when
            considered in light of a number of factors. These factors include
            the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size,
            resources, nature, and structure of the employer’s operation. Undue
            hardship is determined on a case-by-case basis.

              If you have a disability and are qualified to do a job, the ADA
              protects you from job discrimination on the basis of your
              disability. Under the ADA, you have a disability if you have a
              physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major
              life activity. The ADA also protects you if you have a history of
              such a disability, or if an employer believes that you have such a
              disability, even if you do not. To be protected under the ADA, you
              must have, have a record of, or be regarded as having a
              substantial, as opposed to a minor, impairment. A substantial
              impairment is one that significantly limits or restricts a major
              life activity such as hearing, seeing, speaking, walking,
              breathing, performing manual tasks, caring for oneself, learning
              or working.

            <p>
              Reasonable accommodation is any change or adjustment to a job or
              work environment that permits a qualified applicant or employee
              with a disability to participate in the job application process,
              to perform the essential functions of a job, or to enjoy benefits
              and privileges of employment equal to those enjoyed by employees
              without disabilities.

          <div class="content">
            <p>Examples of reasonable accommodations include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible
                to and usable by an individual with a disability;
              </li>
              <li>Modifying work schedules;</li>
              <li>Acquiring or modifying equipment;</li>
              <li>
                Appropriately modifying documents, training, or other programs,
                etc.
              </li>
              <li>Leave of Absence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Employers are not required to lower quality or quantity standards
              in order to make an accommodation, nor are they obligated to
              provide personal use items such as glasses or hearing aids.
            </p>
            <p>
              The decision as to the appropriate accommodation for a specific
              individual must be based on the facts of each case. In selecting
              the reasonable accommodation to be provided, the principal test is
              that of effectiveness, i.e., whether the accommodation will enable
              the person with a disability to do the job in question.

              Must employers be familiar with the many diverse types of
              disabilities to know whether or how to make a reasonable
              accommodation?
            </p>

          </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              No. An employer is required to accommodate only a "known"
              disability of a qualified applicant or employee.
            </p>
            <p>
              The requirement generally will be triggered by a request from an
              individual with a disability, who frequently can suggest an
              appropriate accommodation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Accommodations must be made on an individual basis because the
              nature and extent of a disabling condition and the requirements of
              the job will vary in each case.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the individual does not request an accommodation, the employer
              is not obligated to provide one. If a disabled person requests,
              but cannot suggest, an appropriate accommodation, the employer and
              the individual should work together through an interactive process
              to identify one.

            <p>
              The disabled individual requiring the accommodation must be
              otherwise qualified, and the disability must be known to the
              employer. In addition, an employer is not required to make an
              accommodation if it would impose an "undue hardship" on the
              operation of the employer's business.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Undue hardship" is defined as "an action requiring significant
              difficulty or expense" when considered in light of a number of
              factors. These factors include the nature and cost of the
              accommodation in relation to the size, resources, nature, and
              structure of the employer's operation.
